**Swiftlet Data** is a suite of backend controls designed to quickly and easily add support for several common databases and data formats (such as SQLite, JSON, XML and CloudKit) to your app.

 > NOTE: **Swiftlet Data** is a replacement for our [Action Data](https://github.com/Appracatappra/ActionData) library specifically designed to work with **SwiftUI**.

**Swiftlet Data** provides both light weight, low-level access to the data sources along with high level **Object Relationship Management** (ORM) support (using Swift's `Codable`, `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols.

Created by developers, for developers. Appracatappra's controls are designed to be quickly added to your app's project with a minimum of code and effort, making it easy to add high-quality, professional features and functionality to your app without having to write tons of repetitive, boilerplate code.

<a name="Installation"></a>
## Installation

**Swift Package Manager** (Xcode 11 and above)

1. Select **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Add Package Dependencyâ€¦** from the **File** menu.
2. Paste `https://github.com/Appracatappra/SwiftletData.git` in the dialog box.
3. Follow the Xcode's instruction to complete the installation.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or blank?

Supporting multiple dependency managers makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.

Since, the **Swift Package Manager** is integrated with Xcode 11 (and greater), it's the easiest choice to support going further.

## Using Swiftlet Data

**Swiftlet Data** requires the **Swiftlet Utilities** framework to be added to your project as well. The easiest way to accomplish this download the source code for both frameworks from GitHub and drag the `SwiftletUtilities.xcodeproj` and `SwiftletData.xcodeproj` project files under your project's hierarchy in Xcode.

Additionally you should add the `SwiftletData.framework` and `SwiftletUtilities.framework` files to the your project's **Embedded Binaries** under the **General** tab in Xcode:

## What's Included

**Swiftlet Data** adds the following functionality:

* [Action Codable](#Action-Codable) - Uses Swift's  `Codable`, `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols to move information between your data models and our portable `ADRecord` and `ADRecordSet` formats.
	* [Swift Portable Object Notation](#Swift-Portable-Object-Notation) - The new **Swift Portable Object Notation** (SPON) data format that allows complex data models to be encoded in a portable text string that encodes not only property keys and data, but also includes type information about the encoded data.
* [Swiftlet Data Providers](#Action-Data-Providers) - Provides light weight, low-level access and high-level **Object Relationship Management** (ORM) support to several common databases and data formats such as SQLite, JSON, XML, SPON and CloudKit.
* [Action SQL Parser](#Action-SQL-Parser) - Provides the ability to parse text containing one or more SQL commands into an **Swiftlet Data SQL Document Object Model** (DOM) and is used to provide SQL support for data sources that don't support SQL natively (such as CloudKit and JSON).
* [More Documentation](#More-Documentation-and-Use-Examples) - Visit the Appracatappra website for more information on Swiftlet Data and how to use it.

## Action Codable
 
**Action Codable** controls provide support for several common databases and data formats such as SQLite, JSON, XML and CloudKit using Swift 4's new `Codable`, `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols to move information between your data models and our portable `ADRecord` and `ADRecordSet` formats.
 
With **Action Codable** and **Swiftlet Data Providers**, build your data model objects as simple `struct` or `class` objects and inherit from `ADDataTable`, then use **Action Controls** to quickly create, insert, update, delete and maintain the tables and records in the underlying data source. For example:

```swift
import Foundation
import ActionUtilities
import ActionData

class Category: ADDataTable {
    
    enum CategoryType: String, Codable {
	    case local
	    case web
	}
    
    static var tableName = "Categories"
    static var primaryKey = "id"
    static var primaryKeyType: ADDataTableKeyType = .computedInt
    
    var id = 0
    var added = Date()
    var name = ""
    var description = ""
    var enabled = true
    var highlightColor = UIColor.white.toHex()
    var type: CategoryType = .local
    var icon: Data = UIImage().toData()
    
    required init() {
        
    }
}
```

This includes support for complex tables with nested objects, arrays and dictionaries and complex relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. For example:

```swift
import Foundation
import ActionUtilities
import ActionData

struct Address: Codable {
    var addr1 = ""
    var addr2 = ""
    var city = ""
    var state = ""
    var zip = ""
}

class Person: ADDataTable {
    
    static var tableName = "People"
    static var primaryKey = "id"
    static var primaryKeyType = ADDataTableKeyType.autoUUIDString
    
    var id = UUID().uuidString
    var firstName = ""
    var lastName = ""
    var addresses: [String:Address] = [:]
    
    required init() {
        
    }
    
    init(firstName: String, lastName:String, addresses: [String:Address] = [:]) {
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.addresses = addresses
    }
}

class Group: ADDataTable {
    
    static var tableName = "Groups"
    static var primaryKey = "id"
    static var primaryKeyType = ADDataTableKeyType.autoUUIDString
    
    var id = UUID().uuidString
    var name = ""
    var people = ADCrossReference<Person>(name: "PeopleInGroup", leftKeyName: "groupID", rightKeyName: "personID")
    
    required init() {
        
    }
    
    init(name: String, people: [Person] = []) {
        self.name = name
        self.people.storage = people
    }
}
```

### Swift Portable Object Notation

**Action Codable** also introduces support for the new **Swift Portable Object Notation** (SPON) data format that allows complex data models to be encoded in a portable text string that encodes not only property keys and data, but also includes type information about the encoded data. For example, using the `Address` struct above:

```swift
@obj:Address<state$=`TX` city$=`Seabrook` addr1$=`25 Nasa Rd 1` zip$=`77586` addr2$=`Apt #123`>
```
The portable, human-readable string format encodes values with a single character _type designator_ as follows:
     
* `%` - Bool
* `!` - Int
* `$` - String
* `^` - Float
* `&` - Double
* `*` - Embedded `NSData` or `Data` value
     
Additionally, embedded arrays will be in the `@array[...]` format and embedded dictionaries in the `@obj:type<...>` format.

### Swiftlet Data Providers

**Swiftlet Data Providers** provide light weight, low-level access to several common databases and data formats such as SQLite, JSON, XML, SPON and CloudKit. Results are returned as a key/value dictionary (`ADRecord`) or as an array of key/value dictionaries (`ADRecordSet`). For example:

```swift
let provider = ADSQLiteProvider.shared
let record = try provider.query("SELECT * FROM Categories WHERE id = ?", withParameters: [1])
print(record["name"])
```

Additionally, **Swiftlet Data Providers** provide high-level **Object Relationship Management** (ORM) functionality using **Action Codable** controls and data models conforming to the `ADDataTable` protocol. For example, using the `Address`, `Person` and `Group` data models presented above:

```swift
let addr1 = Address(addr1: "PO Box 1234", addr2: "", city: "Houston", state: "TX", zip: "77012")
let addr2 = Address(addr1: "25 Nasa Rd 1", addr2: "Apt #123", city: "Seabrook", state: "TX", zip: "77586")
    
let p1 = Person(firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", addresses: ["home":addr1, "work":addr2])
let p2 = Person(firstName: "Sue", lastName: "Smith", addresses: ["home":addr1, "work":addr2])
    
let group = Group(name: "Employees", people: [p1, p2])
try provider.save(group)
```

Creates the `People`, `Group` and `PeopleInGroups` SQLite database tables (if required) and inserts the new record instances, with relationships, into the database. For example:

![](Images/Intro01.png)

To retrieve the `Group` from the database, use the following:

```swift
let group = try provider.getRow(ofType: Group.self, forPrimaryKeyValue: "F6DEC3CD-DA62-4A08-A2B6-272E62A7F6E3")
```

The **Swiftlet Data Providers** are designed to be interchangeable, so you can start developing locally using a SQLite database and a `ADSQLiteProvider`, then later switch to CloudKit and a `ADCloudKitProvider` without have to change any of your other code.

Additionally, **Swiftlet Data Providers** can be used to move data from one source to another. For example, download data from the web in JSON using a `ADJSONProvider` and save it to a local SQLite database using a `ADSQLiteProvider`, all with a minimal of code.

Several of our **Action Controls** are designed to take an **Swiftlet Data Provider** as input (such as **ActionTable**), making it easy to work with complex data and common display and input methodologies that would typically require tons of repetitive, boilerplate code.

<a name="Action-SQL-Parser"></a>
## Action SQL Parser

The `ADSQLParser` provides the ability to parse text containing one or more SQL commands into an **Swiftlet Data SQL Document Object Model** (DOM) and is used to provide SQL support for data sources that don't support SQL natively (such as CloudKit and JSON).

The `ADSQLParser` uses SQLite's SQL syntax and currently support a subset of the full SQL language. For example:

```swift
let sql = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parts
(
	part_id           INTEGER   PRIMARY KEY,
	stock             INTEGER   DEFAULT 0   NOT NULL,
	description       TEXT      CHECK( description != '' )    -- empty strings not allowed
);
"""

let instructions = try ADSQLParser.parse(sql)
print(instructions)
```
